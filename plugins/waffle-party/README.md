# Waffle Party

Create a shared queue with `/play` followed by a YouTube video or playlist URL.
Everyone who joins the party hears the same selected track and can use its
room-wide controls.

## Use

Start a party with either URL type:

```text
/play https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID
/play https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAYLIST_ID
```

Open the queue to add more video or playlist URLs. Party members can select a
numbered track, remove it, go to the previous or next track, seek, pause/play,
adjust the local volume, and cycle looping between off, one track, and the
entire queue. At the final track, next restarts it in track-loop mode and wraps
to the first track in queue-loop mode. The queue shows video titles
and becomes scrollable after about ten tracks. Playback and queue actions use
the same icon controls as an in-call player; YouTube's embedded controls are
intentionally blocked so only synchronized Waffle controls can affect a party.

The host can disband the party. A participant may join only one Waffle Party in
the same room at a time; refreshing or leaving removes that participant. If the
host disconnects, members wait five seconds before closing the party and cancel
that close if the host reconnects.

Volume is a per-listener browser preference stored under
`awful:plugin:waffle-party:audio_prefs`; it is never sent to the room. A new
party starts playing when it has a selected track, and a listener joining an
active party is synchronized to the live selected track, position, and playing
state. Browser autoplay policy can still require that listener to press Play.

After closing a populated party, its creator can use **Recruwuate party :3** on
only their latest closed party in that room, provided they are not already in
another active party. It opens a new party with the same queue and selected
track, without carrying members or activity forward.

## Playlists

Playlist URLs do not require an API key: the party host's embedded player reads
the playlist and shares up to 200 video IDs with the room. Tracks are shared in
two-video batches so playback can begin before a long playlist has fully joined
the queue. The card shows `Reading playlist…` while YouTube is resolving it and
then reports batch progress.

## Install

Add this repository to `PLUGIN_SOURCES` and redeploy:

```text
PLUGIN_SOURCES=awful-org/awfully-awesome#<tag-or-sha>
```

## Requirements

None. The plugin uses the official visible YouTube embed in each participant's
browser and needs no API key or relay configuration.

Privacy note: track titles resolve through YouTube's public oEmbed endpoint
from each participant's browser, so YouTube sees participants' IPs for queued
titles - the same party the embedded player itself already talks to during
playback.

It does not extract audio, inject music into voice calls, search YouTube, or
promise frame-accurate synchronization. Browser autoplay rules can require each
participant to press Play once.
